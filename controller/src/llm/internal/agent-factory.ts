// Named-agent factory — bundles an agent's persona, schema, tools, and loop
// limits in one declarable block, then exposes a `.run({ messages, ... })`
// method that resolves the dynamic bits at call time and delegates to djAgent.
//
// Why bother: every djAgent call site used to repeat the same shape —
// build system, build tools, hand both to djAgent with the same schema /
// maxSteps / timeoutMs — and the agent's "spec" was scattered between the
// call site and sdk.js. Pulling it into a single `defineAgent({...})` block
// makes the agent's identity readable in one place, lets tests import the same
// spec constants the live station uses (no drift), and means adding a new agent
// is a declarative block instead of a fresh ad-hoc call.
//
// Persona/tools stay dynamic because both change per call:
//   - buildSystem() resolves the on-air persona at call time (operator may
//     have swapped persona since the module loaded).
//   - buildTools() takes per-call state (recently-played ids, segment cooldown
//     memory, current context) and returns the AI SDK tool set plus an
//     optional `extras` blob the caller needs back (the picker's `seen` map,
//     used to resolve the agent's chosen id to a full song object).
