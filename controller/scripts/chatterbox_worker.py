Chatterbox TTS worker — line-protocol child process.

The Node side (controller/src/audio/chatterbox.ts) spawns this once and keeps
it alive, because loading the Chatterbox Turbo model takes ~10-30s and we don't
want to eat that on every DJ link. Protocol is one JSON object per line over
stdin/stdout, identical in shape to kokoro_worker.py.

Request:  {"id": "...", "text": "...", "out": "/path/to.wav",
           "reference_wav": "/optional/reference.wav"}
Response: {"id": "...", "ok": true,  "path": "/path/to.wav", "duration_s": 3.4}
       |  {"id": "...", "ok": false, "error": "..."}

Uses the official `chatterbox-tts` PyPI package — `ChatterboxTurboTTS` from
`chatterbox.tts_turbo`. There is no turn-key ONNX runtime package, so this is
the PyTorch path; it runs on CPU (slow) or CUDA. The model + weights are baked
into the controller image only when it is built with
`--build-arg WITH_CHATTERBOX=1` (see docker/Dockerfile.controller). Weights are
resolved through the Hugging Face cache (HF_HOME), pre-warmed at image build.

# --- long-input chunking (issue #1130) -------------------------------------
# Chatterbox is autoregressive: one generate() over a long block accumulates
# drift and comes out jumbled/garbled somewhere past ~2 sentences (~300 chars),
# with NO error thrown — the well-known Chatterbox long-input failure mode, not
# anything SUB/WAVE-specific. Piper/Kokoro don't hit it (they aren't
# autoregressive). The mitigation is to synthesise long segments a chunk at a
# time so the model never sees a block long enough to drift, then stitch the
# audio back together. Short lines (station IDs, one-line links — the common
# case) stay a single chunk, so their output is byte-identical to before.
