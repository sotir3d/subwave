# SUB/WAVE

**A personal internet radio station.** One Icecast stream, one broadcast.
Every listener hears the same thing at the same time. An AI DJ picks the
tracks and talks between them: station idents, time checks, the weather,
a quick intro for whatever's going out next. You can ask for music in plain
language; the DJ works out what you meant and slots it in.

It's *radio*, not a playlist. No per-listener shuffle, no skip button, no
"up next for you." You tune in and hear whatever is on.

## Features

- **One shared Icecast stream.** Every listener hears the same broadcast at the same time.
- **AI DJ that picks and talks.** Curates tracks, writes intros, and reads station idents, the time, and the weather.
- **Plain-language requests.** "Play something more upbeat" or "anything by Radiohead" works.
- **Your own music library.** Pulls from Navidrome over the Subsonic API. No external catalogue.
- **Swappable LLM provider.** Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Requesty, Vercel AI Gateway, or any OpenAI-compatible server. Change it from the admin UI with no redeploy. A daily token budget can cap hosted-model spend; past the cap the music keeps playing without the chatter.
- **Six TTS engines.** Piper and Kokoro (multilingual) in-process for fast local speech, plus an optional `tts-heavy` sidecar (`docker compose --profile tts-heavy up -d`) that adds Chatterbox (zero-shot voice cloning) and PocketTTS (6× real-time, EN/FR/DE/IT/ES/PT). Cloud (OpenAI / ElevenLabs) and a Remote engine (any self-hosted HTTP endpoint, audio over the wire) round it out. Pick a different engine per kind of speech.
- **Windows Echo-TTS bridge.** The included [`tools/echo-tts`](tools/echo-tts/README.md) service keeps Echo resident on a Windows CUDA GPU and sends strict PCM WAV audio to a SUB/WAVE controller running locally or on another Linux host.
- **Multiple DJ personas.** Up to 24 in the roster, each with its own voice and writing style. A show can seat up to three guest co-hosts who trade scripted banter with the host, and ready-made personas install from the [community catalog](https://www.getsubwave.com/personas).
- **Multi-format broadcast.** MP3 always served (configurable bitrate) for Sonos, hardware radios, and cars; optional Opus, AAC, and lossless FLAC mounts, each toggleable from the admin UI. The web player picks automatically.
- **Native apps and PWA.** Native iOS (on the App Store) and Android (on Google Play) players — background audio, lock-screen / CarPlay / Android Auto controls, multi-station — a [native desktop player](https://github.com/getsubwave/subwave-desktop) for macOS / Windows / Linux with a menu-bar mini player and live spectrum, plus an installable PWA on phone and desktop.
- **Scheduled shows.** A 24×7 grid; each slot has its own persona, mood, and skills, or anchors to a Navidrome playlist. Ready-made show templates install from the [community catalog](https://www.getsubwave.com/shows).
- **Programmes.** A show can air as a produced episode: the DJ drafts a per-episode plan — an angle, one feature beat each hour, an intro and an outro — so a three-hour slot hangs together instead of being three hours of unrelated links.
- **Pluggable skills.** The DJ's between-track segments — weather, news, traffic, and your own — are skills. The built-ins are scaffolded as editable files under `state/skills/<kind>/` on first boot, so you can rewrite a brief or change the news feed (BBC → your own RSS) right from the admin console — no code, no redeploy. Add your own by dropping a `SKILL.md` (plus optional data-fetching code) into `state/skills/`, hitting Rescan, and enabling it — or write one in the admin UI's built-in editor, or install one other operators shared on the [community exchange](https://www.getsubwave.com/skills). See [`docs/custom-skills.md`](docs/custom-skills.md).
- **Mood-aware rotation.** Time of day, weather, and festival days bias what gets played and how the DJ talks — and the mood vocabulary itself is yours to edit on a dedicated admin page (words, "sounds like" descriptions, and which mood each moment of the day leans into).
- **Ending-aware transitions.** The bundled analyzer measures BPM, key, loudness, and how every track actually ends, so crossfades size themselves to the material: a real fade rides out long, a cold ending cuts tight. Vocal detection keeps the DJ from talking over a sung intro, and opt-in stem blends mix the outgoing tail into the incoming head for a produced-sounding seam. DJ speech ducks the music and lifts it back up.
- **Playlist builder.** Describe a playlist in plain language at `/admin/playlists` and the builder turns it into a recipe, resolves it against your library, and keeps recipe-backed playlists topped up as new music lands.
- **Station imaging.** Jingles, SFX stingers, and instrumental talk-over beds on one admin page — render them through the DJ's voice, generate them from a text prompt, or upload your own audio.
- **Player skins + themes.** Six player faces — Classic, Unit SW-9, Platter, Drift, Subamp, and TTY — with a station default and a per-listener override, plus a theme editor with live preview for colours and type.
- **Private station mode.** Two independent locks over one station password: hide the web player behind a prompt, and/or require listener auth on every stream mount.
- **Multi-station profiles.** Keep several stations in one install — each with its own library pool, DJ roster, schedule, and settings — and switch which one is live from the admin.
- **Hourly archives (opt-in).** Save every hour as MP3 for later replay.
- **Scrobbling.** Every spin can report to Last.fm and ListenBrainz, including self-hosted ListenBrainz instances.
- **DJ Doc.** A built-in station check-up: runs diagnostics across the stack, then has your configured LLM review the findings.
- **Admin console.** Live status, queue, booth log, personas, shows, skills, playlists, moods, imaging, stations, stats, and a debug view of recent LLM calls.
- **Library Observatory.** A full-screen, data-art map of every tagged track at `/observatory` — placed by genre, lit by energy, with a full dossier per track (BPM, key, mood, embedding fingerprints, and nearest-in-vector-space neighbours). Scales from a few hundred to tens of thousands of tracks.
- **MCP server.** External agents (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) can request songs and drive the DJ.
- **Self-hosted.** One `docker compose up -d` on a single Linux host. Optional Cloudflare in front for TLS.

## Why it's built this way

A playlist is a list you control. Radio is a broadcast you join. SUB/WAVE
is the second kind:

- **One shared stream.** A single Icecast mount everyone connects to.
  Everyone hears the same audio at the same instant. That's what makes it
  a station instead of a jukebox.
- **No skip.** Track-end is the only natural transition. The DJ — human-curated
  personas plus an LLM — owns the pacing, not the listener. (Operators *can*
  skip via the admin API; listeners cannot.)
- **AI as the DJ, not the catalogue.** The music is your own library, served
  by Navidrome over the Subsonic API. The LLM picks what's next and talks
  between tracks. It doesn't generate music and it doesn't replace your taste.
- **Self-hosted and swappable.** Runs on one Linux box behind Cloudflare. The
  LLM provider is swappable at runtime (Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google,
  OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway) with no redeploy.

## Quick start (CLI — recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.getsubwave.com | sh    # installs, then offers to init + start
subwave setup                              # connect Navidrome + LLM
```

Two Enter prompts during the installer (`Run subwave init now?`, then
`Bring the stack up now?`) and the stack is on-air. `subwave setup`
connects Navidrome and your LLM, or do the same in the browser at
`http://localhost:7700/onboarding`.

No clone, no Node on the host. `subwave status / logs / doctor / update`
work from anywhere afterwards.

## Quick start (no CLI, raw docker)

If you'd rather skip our binary on your host and stick to `docker compose`:

```bash
mkdir subwave && cd subwave
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perminder-klair/subwave/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perminder-klair/subwave/main/.env.example
mv .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set ADMIN_USER, ADMIN_PASS, SITE_URL (three vars, that's it).
docker compose up -d
# Then open https://your-host/onboarding. The web wizard collects Navidrome,
# LLM, TTS, DJ persona, and offers to render jingles.
```

Functionally identical: same images, same state layout, same persistence.
The CLI just saves you the curl-and-edit dance and gives you `subwave logs`,
`subwave doctor`, etc. for the rest of the lifecycle.

### Heavy TTS engines (optional)

Chatterbox (zero-shot voice cloning) and PocketTTS (fast multilingual) live in
a separate `subwave-tts-heavy` sidecar that adds ~5–6 GB of PyTorch and is
**not** started by default. To enable:

```bash
docker compose --profile tts-heavy up -d
```

The controller is wired up to discover the sidecar automatically. Stop it
again with `docker compose --profile tts-heavy stop tts-heavy`; the rest of
the stack keeps running and Chatterbox/PocketTTS personas silently fall back
to Piper. The old `docker build --build-arg WITH_CHATTERBOX=1` path still
works if you already have a custom-built controller image — see
`docker/Dockerfile.controller`.

**Run just one engine.** Both engines load by default, but each costs RAM and a
first-boot weight download. If you only use one, name it in `.env` and the other
never loads:

```ini
TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES=pocket-tts       # PocketTTS only (no Chatterbox)
# TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES=chatterbox     # Chatterbox only
# TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES=chatterbox,pocket-tts   # default — both
```

Acoustic analysis (tempo/key/loudness) does **not** need the heavy TTS sidecar —
it runs in its own `subwave-analyzer` service, which **starts by default**
alongside the controller and web. The default image is **lean and multi-arch**
(~1.1 GB, no PyTorch — so it runs natively on arm64 NAS/Pi/Apple-Silicon). The
two heavier dimensions — CLAP **"sounds-like"** embeddings and **Demucs** vocal
ranges — are the opt-in tier; enable them by pulling the heavy image, no rebuild:

```bash
# in your root .env
ANALYZER_HEAVY=1
```

That repoints the `analyzer` service at `subwave-analyzer-heavy` (CLAP + Demucs,
~1.9 GB, amd64) on the next `docker compose up -d`. The `subwave setup` wizard
also offers it, and Unraid one-click users pull the `subwave-aio-heavy` image
instead. Only the expressive *voices* above need the separate `tts-heavy` sidecar.

Hosts with an NVIDIA GPU can run the heavy stack on CUDA instead — layer the
`docker-compose.analyzer-gpu.yml` overlay, which swaps the service to the
`subwave-analyzer-cuda` image and reserves the GPU (needs the NVIDIA driver +
Container Toolkit, nothing else):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.analyzer-gpu.yml up -d
```

All-in-one installs have no `analyzer` service to swap, so they take the GPU on
the image instead: pull `subwave-aio-cuda` and hand the container the card
(`--gpus all`, or the Unraid steps in [`docs/unraid.md`](docs/unraid.md)).

### Local dev (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perminder-klair/subwave.git && cd subwave
./scripts/setup.sh                                  # scaffolds a 3-var root .env + state/
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d      # Broadcast (icecast2 + liquidsoap) + Controller
cd web && npm install && npm run dev                # web UI on :7700, separate and hot-reloading
# Then http://localhost:7700/onboarding to finish configuration.
```

Dev compose bind-mounts `controller/src/`, `radio.liq`, and `sounds/` from the
repo. Controller runs under `tsx watch` so `src/**` edits hot-reload inside
the container; `radio.liq` edits just need a `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart broadcast`.

The standalone `subwave` CLI works inside the cloned repo too. `cd subwave &&
subwave start dev` does the right thing. The contributor convenience is `npm
start`, which `tsx`-runs the CLI source directly so unreleased changes are
exercised. Same commands, same flags, no `npm install -g` needed.

The same CLI doubles as the console for running the station. Run `npm start`
for a status-aware menu; every menu action is also a one-shot subcommand,
appended after `npm start --`:

```bash
npm start                       # interactive operator console (status-aware menu)
npm start -- setup              # first-boot wizard: Navidrome, LLM, admin, env files
npm start -- status             # compose env, services, now-playing, recent events
npm start -- doctor             # full diagnostic sweep
npm start -- start dev          # docker compose up -d (dev or prod)
npm start -- restart broadcast  # plain restart (radio.liq is bind-mounted in dev)
npm start -- restart controller # rebuild + recreate (source is COPY-d at build)
npm start -- logs controller    # tail one service
npm start -- listen             # open the web player in a browser
npm start -- admin              # open the admin console in a browser
npm start -- stop               # docker compose down (confirms first)
```

## Production deploy

Single Linux host, Cloudflare terminating TLS, Caddy routing to four internal
services. The [no-CLI quickstart above](#quick-start-no-cli-raw-docker) is
the canonical path: `curl` two files, fill in three vars, `docker compose
up -d`, finish setup in the browser. See **[`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md)** for host
prerequisites, Cloudflare setup, updates, and backup.

**On Unraid?** One-click install from **[Community Applications](https://ca.unraid.net/apps/sub-wave-073qgwu0ch9rtu)**
(search **SUB/WAVE** in the Apps tab) — or run the full split-container stack via
the Compose Manager Plus plugin. Both in **[`docs/unraid.md`](docs/unraid.md)**.

**Bring your own reverse proxy.** If you already run Traefik, nginx, or your
own Caddy in your homelab, swap the bundled-Caddy compose for the BYO variant:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.byo.yml up -d
```

That exposes the web UI on `:7700`, the controller API on `:7701`, and the
Icecast stream on `:7702` (all configurable). Point your proxy at those three.
`docker/Caddyfile` is a working reference for the route table you need to
replicate. Details in [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md#bring-your-own-reverse-proxy).

**Images on GHCR.** Tagged releases publish to `ghcr.io/perminder-klair/subwave-{caddy,broadcast,controller,web}`, the default-on `subwave-analyzer` (lean, multi-arch acoustic analysis) sidecar, and the opt-in `subwave-tts-heavy` (expressive voices) sidecar. Heavy-analysis variants — `subwave-analyzer-heavy` and `subwave-aio-heavy` (CLAP + Demucs, amd64) — are published for operators who enable "sounds-like"/vocals, plus the NVIDIA CUDA builds of that heavy stack (amd64) — `subwave-analyzer-cuda` for split-stack hosts via the `docker-compose.analyzer-gpu.yml` overlay, and `subwave-aio-cuda` for one-click all-in-one hosts.
All compose files pull `:latest` by default; pin a version with
`SUBWAVE_VERSION=v1.2.3` in the root `.env`.

## Notable details

- **Controller code needs a rebuild, not a restart**, because its source is
  `COPY`d at image build time. `radio.liq` is bind-mounted, so a Liquidsoap
  restart is enough after editing it.
- **The LLM provider is swappable at runtime** from the admin UI. Every model
  call goes through the Vercel AI SDK.
- **There is no `/skip` for listeners.** Track-end is the only natural
  transition; operators have an admin-only skip endpoint.
- **Add to Sonos / VLC with one link.** Hardware and software players take a
  playlist file, not a raw stream URL — paste `https://<your-station>/listen.pls`
  (or `/listen.m3u`) into Sonos, VLC, moOde, or a car receiver and it tunes
  straight in. Both are public (no auth), point at the always-served MP3 mount
  (plus Opus when you've enabled it), and resolve the origin from `SITE_URL`
  when set, otherwise the address you reached the station on (LAN / Tailscale /
  custom domain). `/api/now-playing` also carries a `stream` block
  (`mount`, `format`, `bitrate`, `sampleRate`, `channels`) for clients that want
  the broadcast's shape.
- **Navidrome ≥0.62 is recommended.** It ships several security hardening
  fixes (internet-radio management now admin-gated, transcode-config
  disclosure restricted to admins, concurrent-transcode DoS limits) and the
  OpenSubsonic `sonicSimilarity` extension. SUB/WAVE streams with `format=raw`
  so the transcode limits never throttle the radio, and when `sonicSimilarity`
  is enabled the picker automatically folds Navidrome's audio-based neighbours
  in as an extra track-selection source — no config, capability-probed, and a
  silent no-op when the extension is absent. Any reasonably recent Navidrome
  still works.
- Several areas (queue/playback path, `radio.liq`, the crossfade, voice
  ducking, the LLM layer) have **non-obvious constraints** that are easy to
  regress. Read the relevant note in **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)** before
  touching them.

## Music licensing

SUB/WAVE is playback and automation software. It does **not** grant you any
rights to the music you broadcast through it, and it ships with no licensed
content.

Owning a file — a purchased download, a CD you ripped, anything in your
Navidrome library — covers your own private listening. It does **not** cover
**public performance**. The moment SUB/WAVE streams to anyone but you, you are
publicly performing copyrighted works, which in most countries requires
licences for *two* separate rights:

- the **musical composition** (songwriting) — e.g. PRS for Music (UK),
  ASCAP / BMI / SESAC (US);
- the **sound recording** (the master) — e.g. PPL (UK), SoundExchange (US,
  under the statutory webcasting licence and its DMCA §114 conditions).

You are the broadcaster and you are solely responsible for clearing those
rights. If you don't want to obtain licences, run the station privately (see
[DEPLOY.md → Make the station private](DEPLOY.md#make-the-station-private-cloudflare-access)),
or broadcast only content you're cleared to use — music you created or own the
rights to, Creative-Commons-licensed tracks, royalty-free libraries, or
public-domain recordings.

This is general information, not legal advice. If you run a public station,
talk to a media/IP lawyer in your jurisdiction.
