        <h2>Local voices, or the cloud.</h2>
        <p>
          You pick the engine under <strong>Admin &rarr; TTS voice</strong>. Four are
          built in, one is hosted, and one points at a server you run yourself.
        </p>
        <ul className="bs-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Piper</strong> is the default. It's compact, runs on practically any
            hardware, and renders speech faster than real time. The voice is clear but a
            little synthetic. It also doubles as the station's safety net (see below).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kokoro</strong> is a local neural model that sounds markedly more
            natural, closer to a real broadcaster. It's heavier: it loads a model into
            memory and takes longer per line, so it wants a bit of CPU and RAM headroom.
            It ships a range of voices, with a British selection surfaced in the console.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chatterbox</strong> clones a voice from a short reference clip, so each
            persona can have its own distinct sound, and it voices paralinguistic cues like{' '}
            <em>[laugh]</em> and <em>[sigh]</em> as real sounds. It's the most capable
            local engine and the heaviest: comfortable on a GPU, slow on CPU. It lives in
            the optional <code className="bs-code-inline">tts-heavy</code> sidecar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PocketTTS</strong> is a small, multilingual model from kyutai-labs that
            runs about six times faster than real time on CPU, with built-in voices in
            English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. It sits between Piper
            (fast, robotic) and Chatterbox (heavy, expressive), in the same{' '}
            <code className="bs-code-inline">tts-heavy</code> sidecar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud</strong> is hosted text-to-speech through OpenAI or ElevenLabs,
            using an API key. It's the most lifelike of the six, but it costs per use and
            depends on the network being up. The Cloud engine also speaks{' '}
            <strong>OpenAI-compatible</strong>, so it can point at any self-hosted speech
            server, including a Chatterbox box on your own GPU (see below).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remote</strong> is a TTS server you run yourself — a LAN box, a
            Tailscale host, a spare GPU — that speaks a tiny Subwave-native HTTP
            contract. It's the clean way to self-host an engine like Qwen3-TTS, F5-TTS
            or CosyVoice without dressing it up as another provider (see below).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You don't have to commit to one. The operator can assign a different engine{' '}
          <em>per kind</em> of segment (a rich cloud voice for station IDs, say, but a
          fast local voice for routine time checks), with everything else falling through
          to a default engine.

            If a voice ever fails (a cloud outage, a model that isn't installed), the
            station drops to a local engine automatically. Piper is always there as the
            last resort, so a spoken segment is never lost to a missing voice.

        <h2>Enabling the tts-heavy sidecar.</h2>
        <p>
          Piper and Kokoro ship inside the controller image, and the cloud engine just
          needs an API key. Chatterbox and PocketTTS are the exceptions: they drag in a
          few GB of PyTorch and model weights between them, so they live in a separate,
          opt-in <code className="bs-code-inline">tts-heavy</code> container rather than
          being bundled into every install.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enable, set <code className="bs-code-inline">COMPOSE_PROFILES=tts-heavy</code>{' '}
          in your <code className="bs-code-inline">.env</code> and bring the stack up:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock>{`echo COMPOSE_PROFILES=tts-heavy >> .env
docker compose up -d`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          For a one-off start without persisting the choice, run{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">docker compose --profile tts-heavy up -d</code>{' '}
          instead. The setup wizard at <code className="bs-code-inline">/onboarding</code>{' '}
          also writes the env var for you if you tick &ldquo;Enable Chatterbox +
          PocketTTS&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the sidecar is up, both engines show as available under{' '}
          <strong>Admin &rarr; TTS voice</strong>. For voice cloning (Chatterbox or
          PocketTTS), drop a short reference WAV into{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">state/voices/</code>{' '}
          (legacy <code className="bs-code-inline">state/chatterbox-voices/</code> is
          still read) and pick it on the Personas page. Without one, both engines use
          their built-in default voice. PocketTTS also exposes a curated set of built-in
          voice ids (<code className="bs-code-inline">alba</code>,{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">anna</code>,{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">charles</code>, …) alongside any cloned voices.
          Until the sidecar is started, selecting either engine silently falls back to
          Piper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both engines load when the sidecar starts, but each is a separate PyTorch
          model that costs memory and a first-boot weight download. If you only use one,
          name it in <code className="bs-code-inline">.env</code> and the other never
          loads &mdash; comma-separated, defaulting to both:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock>{`TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES=pocket-tts       # PocketTTS only (no Chatterbox)
# TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES=chatterbox     # Chatterbox only
# TTS_HEAVY_ENGINES=chatterbox,pocket-tts   # default — both`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          Bring the sidecar back up after changing it. If a persona is still pointed at
          the disabled engine, its speech falls back to Piper rather than failing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted">
          For backwards compatibility, the older{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">--build-arg WITH_CHATTERBOX=1</code> /{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">WITH_POCKETTTS=1</code> paths in{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">docker/Dockerfile.controller</code> still work.
          They bundle the engines inside the controller image instead, but the sidecar is
          the recommended path for fresh installs.

        <h2>Your own TTS server.</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Remote</strong> engine points SUB/WAVE at a TTS server you run
          yourself, anywhere the controller can reach over the network — a LAN box, a
          Tailscale host, a spare GPU machine. Unlike the OpenAI-compatible Cloud route
          (which speaks OpenAI&apos;s{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">/v1/audio/speech</code>), Remote speaks a tiny
          Subwave-native contract, so wrapping a model like Qwen3-TTS, F5-TTS or CosyVoice
          in a server is only a few lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Configure it under <strong>Admin &rarr; TTS voice</strong>: pick{' '}
          <strong>Remote</strong> and set <strong>Server URL</strong> to the endpoint
          (e.g. <code className="bs-code-inline">http://192.168.1.101:5001</code>, a LAN or
          Tailscale IP the controller container can reach, not{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">127.0.0.1</code>). The console shows{' '}
          <strong>ready</strong> once the health check passes, and the station falls back
          to Piper whenever the URL is blank or the server is down. A persona&apos;s{' '}
          <strong>Remote voice</strong> is free text forwarded straight to your server — a
          voice id, a reference-WAV filename, a VoiceDesign prompt, whatever it
          understands.

            returns the rendered audio (WAV) <em>in the response body</em>. The audio
            travels over the wire, so no shared filesystem or volume is needed — that&apos;s
            the difference from the bundled{' '}

          set the <code className="bs-code-inline">X-TTS-Fell-Back</code> response header
          and report the exact voice with <code className="bs-code-inline">X-TTS-Voice-Used</code>
          (plus{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">X-TTS-Fell-Back-Reason</code>) and SUB/WAVE logs

            Spoken programmes use this same Remote contract. SUB/WAVE splits a chapter

            WAV responses locally, so a voice server never has to render the whole
            half-hour in one request. A richer health response can advertise the safe

            <code className="bs-code-inline">{`{ "ok": true, "ready": true, "engine": "echotts", "maxSeconds": 30 }`}</code>.
            Engines built for a longer context can report a larger{' '}
            <code className="bs-code-inline">maxSeconds</code>; absent that field, SUB/WAVE
            uses conservative roughly-25-second chunks. EchoTTS and FireRedTTS2 can both
            sit behind this wrapper without becoming controller-specific integrations.

          <p>
            This repository includes a Windows-native EchoTTS bridge under{' '}

            scripts keep Echo resident on a selected CUDA device, serialize synthesis,
            load narrator references from a controlled voice directory, and return strict
            PCM WAV responses for a controller running on another machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each chunk response must be an uncompressed PCM WAV (WAVE format 1), and
            every chunk in a chapter must use the same channel count, sample rate and bit
            depth so it can be joined without transcoding. Long-form rendering is
            strict about voice consistency: return the exact requested id in{' '}

            also return <code className="bs-code-inline">X-TTS-Fell-Back: true</code>. A

        <h2>When CPU isn't enough.</h2>
        <p>
          Chatterbox is the most expressive local engine and the most demanding. On a CPU
          it pegs every core and still runs slower than real time. If you have a GPU there
          are two ways to put it to work, and the easy one needs no rebuild at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The easy route: your own server over the OpenAI layer.</strong>{' '}
          Run a Chatterbox server that exposes an OpenAI-compatible{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">/v1/audio/speech</code> endpoint on your GPU
          machine (the community <em>Chatterbox TTS API</em> project does exactly this),
          then point SUB/WAVE's Cloud engine at it. Under{' '}
          <strong>Admin &rarr; TTS voice</strong>, set the Cloud engine's{' '}
          <strong>Provider</strong> to{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">OpenAI-compatible</code>, put the box's address
          in <strong>Server base URL</strong> (e.g.{' '}

            The OpenAI speech API has no field for a per-request reference clip, but
            SUB/WAVE still forwards the persona's voice <em>name</em>. So you register your
            reference clip as a named voice on the Chatterbox server (an{' '}

            and the clone renders on your GPU. What you give up versus the native route is
            the in-app <code className="bs-code-inline">state/voices/</code> per-persona
            workflow and daypart speed shaping.

          <strong>The native route: GPU-enable the bundled sidecar.</strong>{' '}
          The shipped <code className="bs-code-inline">tts-heavy</code> image installs
          CPU-only PyTorch wheels, so setting{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">TTS_HEAVY_DEVICE=cuda</code> on its own silently
          falls back to CPU. To drive the card natively (and keep reference-WAV cloning),
          point the <code className="bs-code-inline">CHATTERBOX_TORCH_INDEX_URL</code> build
          arg at a CUDA wheel index and bring the sidecar up with the{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">docker-compose.tts-heavy-gpu.yml</code> overlay,
          which carries the GPU reservation for you. No Dockerfile editing, just a local
